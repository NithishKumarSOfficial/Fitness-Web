                <h1>CLEAN EAT DIET</h1>
                <p class="text-justify"><br>The Eat-Clean principles are:

                    Eat six small meals a day.
                    Eat breakfast every day, within an hour of getting up.
                    Eat lean protein and complex carbohydrates at every meal.
                    Have two or three servings of healthy fats every day.
                    Get fiber, vitamins, nutrients, and enzymes from fresh fruits and vegetables.
                    Control your portions.
                    Drink 2 to 3 liters of water (about 13 8-ounce cups) every day.
                    The foods to avoid:
                    
                    Overprocessed foods, especially white flour and sugar
                     Artificial sweeteners
                    Sugary beverages, such as soda and juice
                    Alcohol
                    Foods with chemical additives like food dyes and sodium nitrite
                    Foods with preservatives
                    Artificial foods, such as processed cheese slices
                     Saturated fats and trans fats
                    Anti-foods -- calorie-dense foods with no nutritional value
                    Level of Effort: Medium
                    Limitations: You have some flexibility. If you don’t like foods in Reno’s menu plans, you can replace them with others from the same food group.
                    
                    Cooking and shopping: Planning can save you time grocery shopping, Reno says. Make a shopping list and stick to it. Keep in mind that foods without preservatives may not keep long, meaning more frequent trips to the grocery store. As for meal prep, a complete meal on this plan can be as simple as nuts and a piece of fruit.
                    
                    Packaged foods or meals: None required.
                    
                    In-person meetings: None.
                    
                    Exercise: Strength training and cardiovascular exercise round out the Eat-Clean program. To lose weight, Reno recommends five or six sessions of cardio weekly, for 30 to 45 minutes each. If you’re new to strength training, start with light weights and longer sets.
                    
                    Does It Allow for Dietary Restrictions or Preferences?
                    Reno says the Eat-Clean lifestyle is flexible and adapts to your dietary needs. Just follow the principles, she says, and eat the foods you can.
                    
                    Vegetarians and vegans: This diet works for you. Eating clean doesn’t require eating meat, eggs, or other animal products.
