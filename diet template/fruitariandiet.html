                <h1>FRUITARIAN DIET</h1>
                <p class="text-justify"><br>Plant-based diets may help you lose weight.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vegan-vs-vegetarian">Vegetarianism and veganism</a>&nbsp;are the most popular versions, which restrict animal products for health, ethical,
                    and environmental reasons.However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet, which is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;There
                    are many types of vegetarianism, but most involve eliminating all meat, poultry, and fish. Some vegetarians may likewise avoid eggs and dairy.The vegan diet takes it a step further by restricting all animal products, as well as animal-derived
                    products like dairy, gelatin, honey, whey, casein, and albumin.There are no clear-cut rules for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/flexitarian-diet-guide">flexitarian diet</a>, as it’s a lifestyle change rather
                    than a diet. It encourages eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains but allows for protein and animal products in moderation, making it a popular alternative.Many of the restricted food groups are high in calories,
                    so limiting them may aid weight loss.<br><br><strong>Weight loss:&nbsp;</strong>Research shows that plant-based diets are effective for weight loss (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487971">7Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;
                    <a
                        href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28319109">8Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405108">9Trusted Source</a>).A review of 12 studies including 1,151 participants found that people on a plant-based diet lost an average of 4.4 pounds (2 kg)
                        more than those who included animal products (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26138004">10Trusted Source</a>).Plus, those following a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vegan-diet-guide">vegan diet</a>&nbsp;lost
                        an average of 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg) more than people not eating a plant-based diet (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26138004">10Trusted Source</a>).Plant-based diets likely aid weight loss because they tend to be rich
                        in fiber, which can help you stay fuller for longer, and low in high-calorie fat<br><br><strong>Other benefits:</strong>&nbsp;Plant-based diets have been linked to many other benefits, such as a reduced risk of chronic conditions
                        like heart disease, certain cancers, and diabetes. They can also be more environmentally sustainable than meat-based diets&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Downsides:&nbsp;</strong>Though plant-based diets are healthy, they can restrict important
                        nutrients that are typically found in animal products, such as iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids.A flexitarian approach or proper supplementation can help account for these nutrients.<br><br></p>
