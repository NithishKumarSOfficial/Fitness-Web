                <h1>HIGH-PROTIEN DIET</h1>
                <p class="text-justify"><br>Here are a few basic guidelines for following a high-protein diet:

                    Keep a food diary: Start a food diary using an app or website that provides protein values for thousands of foods and allows you to set your own calorie and macronutrient goals.
                    Calculate protein needs: To calculate your protein needs, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.6–0.75 grams, or your weight in kilograms by 1.2–1.6 grams.
                    Eat at least 25–30 grams of protein at meals: Research has shown that consuming a minimum of 25 grams of protein at meals may promote weight loss, muscle maintenance and better overall health (35Trusted Source).
                    Include both animal and plant proteins in your diet: Eating a combination of both types helps make your diet more nutritious overall.
                    Choose high-quality protein sources: Focus on fresh meats, eggs, dairy and other proteins, rather than processed meats like bacon and lunch meats.
                    Consume well-balanced meals: Balance high-protein foods with vegetables, fruits and other plant foods at every meal.
                    Lastly, this list of 20 delicious high-protein foods can help get you started.The sample below provides about 100 grams of protein per day. However, you can adjust the portions to meet your needs.
